last_free_cell_hint=there is only one cell empty in the {0}th {1}, from 1-9 only left digital is {2}
last_possible_number_hint=for the position {0}, the only possible digital is {1}
hidden_singles_hint=In {0}th {1}, for the digital {2} the only possible place is {3}
obvious_pairs_hint=In {0}th {1}, the position {2} {3} only have the same two candidates{4} {5}, delete {4} {5} in other positions.
obvious_triples_hint=In {0}th {1}, the position {2} {3} {4} only have the same three candidates{5} {6} {7}, delete {5} {6} {7} in other positions.
hidden_pairs_hint=In {0}th {1}, {2} {3} only appear in the position {4} {5}, delete other candidates in the position {4} {5}.
hidden_triples_hint=In {0}th {1}, {2} {3} {4}only appear in the position {5} {6} {7}, delete other candidates in the position {5} {6} {7}.
pointing_pairs_hint={0} only appears in the position {2} of {1}th box, {0} must in this {3} positions; Delete the digital {0} in the {4}th {5}
row_column_to_box_hint=In {0}th {1}, all positions which contain {2} also in the {3}th box, Delete {2}  in the {3}th box's other positions 
x_wing_hint={0} only appears twice in {1}th {2} and {3}th {4} which form a rectangle. {5} and {6} must contain {0}, then delete {0} in other positions of {7}th {8} and {9}th {8}
y_wing_hint=If {0} is {1}, then {2} is {3}, so {4} can not be {3}. If {0} is {5}, then {6} is {3}, so {4} can not be {3}. Delete {3} in the {4}. 
swordfish_hint={4} only appear twice in {0}th {1}th {2}th {3}, and the positions are formed three pairs. Then delete {4} in the {5}th {6}th {7}th {8}
